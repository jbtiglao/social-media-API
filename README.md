  ## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, Mongoose, and native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.. The seed data is created using Insomnia.

  ## Installation
  * Clone my repository on GitHub.

  * Open the file on Visual Studo Code. Create your  `.gitignore` file.
  
  * Check the `package.json`. To set up all the existing npm packages, run `npm init`.

  * To install the dependencies on the `node_modules` folder, run `npm install` or

      * `npm i express` to install Express.js;
      * `npm i mongoose` to install Mongoose; and 
      * `npm i nodemon` to install Nodemon.


  * Ensure that MongoDB is installed on your machine. If not, follow the instructions on the [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

  *(Note: If you're a Mac user, you may need to install MongoDB via Homebrew. There are a number of tutorials on YouTube, but the video that helped me troubleshoot my installation, after trying everything, was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4crXgQZG4W8&t=40s). Prior to installation, you might also need to ensure that you have the current Node.js version (v.17).*

  * Invoke application using `npm start`

  * Open Insomnia to test the API routes.
